#Speed Tracker
#takes a time for a car going past a speed camera,
#the time going past the next one
#the distance between them to calculate the average speed for the car in mph.
#The cameras are one mile apart.
#Extensions:
    #1:
        #Speed cameras know the timings of each car going past,
        #through number plate recognition.
        #Valid number plates are two letters,
        #two numbers and three letters afterwards, for
        #example XX77 787.
        #Produce a part of the program that checks whether a number plate matches
        #the given pattern. Tell the user either way.
    #2:
        #Create a program for creating a file of details for vehicles exceeding
        #the speed limit set for a section of road. You will need to create a
        #suitable file with test data, including
        #randomised number plates and times. You will then use the code youâ€™ve
        #already written to process this list to determine who is breaking the
        #speed limit (70mph) and who has invalid number plates.
