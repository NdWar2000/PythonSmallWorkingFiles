#Thief:
    #A thief has managed to find out the four digits for an online PIN code, 
    #but doesnâ€™t know the correct sequence needed to hack into the account.
    #Design and write a program that displays all the possible combinations 
    #for any four numerical digits entered by the user. 
    #The program should avoid displaying the same combination more than once.
    #Submit a fully detailed Showcase for your program
    
# enter four digit number
